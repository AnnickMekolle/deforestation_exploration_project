# deforestation_exploration_project
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. As a data analyst at ForestQuery, I obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong. I used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.
